    "description": "Who Are We:\n\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs (http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we've hosted 449+ workshops and 15 summits with reach in 18+ countries. With over 28,000+ registrants for our events, we've built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, & more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\n\nWhy Our Proposal Matters:\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there's a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n- Dystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming two events: Hacksummit SF (a 2 day summit right before Stanford Blockchain Conference) and DeFi Bogota (a 1 day summit right before Devcon).\n- We are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $30k. This will help cover venue costs, AV support, furniture, and food.\n- We expect 300-350 ppl per event. And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we'd love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\n- To us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\n- In the past, we've had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot's team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\n- Other sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\n\nWe're Part Of The Ecosystem:\n\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor through events.\n\nNotes added by governance:\n\n- At the time of writing, Evmos is roughly $2.15. $30K / $2.15 is roughly 13,954 when rounded up.\n- Proposal has gone through the recommended guidelines.
