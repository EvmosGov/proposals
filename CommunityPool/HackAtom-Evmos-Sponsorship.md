# Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom 2022 Seoul and Participation in Korea Blockchain Week

## **Summary**

This proposal will provide the funding necessary needed for the sponsorship of the upcoming HackAtom 2022 event in Seoul which will be held July 29th to 31th, followed by the participation in ETH Seoul and Korea Blockchain Week which ends on 14th of August.

## **Abstract**

HackAtom is the largest and most recognized hackathon in the Cosmos ecosystem, organized by the Interchain Foundation with its history dating [back to 2017](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cosmos-hackatom-winners-9fc083098da). A lot has happened since 2017 -- even as the world was momentarily flipped upside down, the Cosmos ecosystem continued to build, and #IBCgang as a whole has achieved countless milestones that the early builders have dreamed of.

Evmos is incredibly special in that it has the best of both worlds - EVM and Cosmos. In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554), which used the Community Pool to ultimately fund the development of Evmos without any external investments or VC backing. It is only appropriate that Evmos not only support these events, but also take these opportunities to grow our network.

Everyone is aware of the famous saying, "If you build it, they will come." The truth of the matter is, at the moment, we are lacking builders. HackAtom is the perfect opportunity to attract top notch developers in both the EVM and the Cosmos networks.

_HackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. This HackATOM will not only be the perfect chance for developers to start their journey in our ecosystem with a bang, but it will also be a real moment of sharing and growing for our entire community._

_Cosmonauts, itâ€™s been over a year since theÂ __[Stargate upgrade](https://stargate.cosmos.network/)__, the Cosmos Big-Bang that announced the start of theÂ __[Interchain Era](https://hub.mintscan.io/ibc-network)__, and since then our ecosystem has faced many challenges but, despite our differing views and opinions, we have always been united in a common front when the moment called for it, acknowledging that our diversities are what make our Interchain Ecosystem thriving._

### **B. Hackathon Prizes**

The prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). 

[Current Hackathon Challenges and Prize Pool](https://bafybeienbj44fytisfpq6a5svc5t32qcxgwjvdkqejfys2degjnhhotbkm.ipfs.dweb.link/tracks.png)

The hackathon tracks and respective rewards for the tracks will be discussed and determined with the core dev team as soon as the proposal is live and is looking likely to pass.

### **C. Marketing and PR Expenses**

Please remember, these numbers are not final, and although I have initiated talks and begun budgeting research, there is still a lot of missing pieces to be filled in. The numbers that I am providing are currently derived as estimates from my past experiences with sponsoring and hosting events. Past events include Blockshow Vegas 2018, BlockchainNW Seattle 2018, LA Blockchain Week 2018, Global AI Conference in Santa Clara, Consensys 2019, LA Blockchain Week 2019, E3 2019's first blockchain gaming stage, and about a dozen smaller meetups with projects. 

**PR Expenses** - Evmos is unique in the Cosmos ecosystem because we are able to tap into a much bigger pool of developers (devs already familiar with solidity). It is my belief that if we are committing $100K into the hackathon, we should do our absolute best to make sure that there is a great turnout with talented developers. 

Right off the bat, I would like to explore one or two paid PR placements in Korea's top blockchain publications and developer networks. Depending on who, when, and how, this can range anywhere from $5K to $10K. However, we will aim for the lower-end of the range while leveraging the existing network of IBC frens.

I will be consulting a few blockchain incubation and investment firms that I am acquainted with for additional advice on how to best penetrate the Korean ETH developer market. There may be some last minute promotions, such as small token giveaways or ad placements in developer-heavy social networks. 

**Marketing Expenses** - Following the HackAtom event, three events will be held consecutively: buidl.asia, ETH Seoul, and Korea Blockchain Week. This gives us a great opportunity to do further outreach beyond the scope of the hackathon, through smaller meetups, cross-promotions, and related events. Side events, when executed properly, can be much more effective than sponsoring the event itself. 

From start to finish, the events will last from July 29th to August 13th. This is a pretty epic blockchain marathon, and the possilities and opportunities for developer onboarding, meetups, workships, and side events are endless. 

Potential "side events" - As of now, talks have been initiated, but nothing is final. A few examples would be: 1) Co-hosting an event with the Interchain Foundation; 2) Hosting an official Korea Blockchain Week 2022 Side Event; 3) Hosting our own series of mini-events in the form of workshops, networking, and hopefully catching the attention of some talented solidy developers while the biggest blockchain event to happen in Asia in over 3 years is underway. When a firm decision is made with the team on how to put the funds to best use, we will let the community know ASAP. Hosting such events can typically cost anywhere from $10K to $30K depending on the event, the venue, the number of people in attendence, and timing. 

**Booth and Evmos Merch** - Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. While the booth design is not extremely important and I do not see a need for an extravagent booth, if we are going to be represented at any event, we might as well do it professionally. From past experiences, the most costly part of booths were rentals -- displays, screens, etc. After speaking with Interchain Foundation and the HackAtom organizers, booth design will not require a significant budget.

It's almost a rule of thumb that a project can not go to an event without bringing merch to give out. I think we can have a bit of fun with the community taking design and idea submissions. Around $2K will be allocated for Evmos merch / swag.

### **D. Airfare + Accomodations + Miscellaneous Expenses**

For those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with BeeHive, a respected Korean validator and community that is active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services. While the event will bring the global community to Seoul, it should be expected that a huge portion of the attendees will, of course be Korean. 

At the moment airfare to Korea from the States as well as Europe are well over $2K. Assuming that four Evmos representaives will in attendance, the cost for airfare should exceed just over $10K. Prices will likely fluctuate between now and then. Accomodation for housing is showing anywhere from $4K to $6K for the time periods of the events.

## Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability 

1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to D. Whatever  transactions that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. 
2. All unused funds will be returned to the community pool.
3. $20K of the marketing and PR budget will be sent to a multi-sig wallet, while $20K will be held in a liquid wallet so that we can immediately get to work on the countless tasks and preparations that need to be made. 
4. The hackathon prize pool will also be sent to a multi-sig wallet and distributed post-event.
5. The miscellaneous fund ("Item D") will be released immediately and distributed to the Evmos representatives that will be in attendance, and roughly $6K will be released to LPX to book housing accomodations for the team as soon as possible. If the number of attending Evmos team member drops, then adjustments will be made acccordingly.

I will work with the core team to be as frugal as possible, while consulting with them to take as many opportunities that would benefit Evmos and help with onboarding and exposure. The multisig signers should be people on the ground in Seoul, so please keep that in mind when proposing signatories. 

## Time Constraints

July 29th is fast approaching. I will continue to be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, blockchain incubators and communities, and everyone in between. Although I hate to sound like a hypocrite in trying to move this through quickly, time is running out.

All these events will be happening roughly 15 minutes from where I live, so I will do my best to accomodate the core Evmos team with any logistical needs. However, I will most likely be needing external help and planning should begin ASAP, so I would appreciate any and all concerns from the community to be asked in a timely manner so that the proposal can move into the next stages ASAP. 

## Other Considerations

The cost to become an official sponsor of Korea Blockchain Week is $50K with no booth, and $100K with booth. We have decided not to sponsor KBW directly, but have confirmed with KBW organizers that whatever side event we decide to host, they will include it in their official list of events, which allows us to tap into their pool of attendees. 

We would like to have sponsored ETH Seoul, they are unfortunately at capacity. However, it should be noted that we also have three major hackathons already planned or in planning that are ETH-community focused, which begin as soon as these events in Korea end. In other words, you can expect the next few months to be very crazy and event-packed for the Evmos ecosystem.

With that being said, if at any point or time something doesn't feel right, or we feel that our spending is not justified, we can simply decide to not host anything, count our blessings and new frens made at HackAtom, and just spend the rest of the time spreading Evmos through good ole' fashioned networking. 

## Multisig Signatories

3 out of 5 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:
- LPX (myself, who will be coordinating much of logistics here in Seoul)
- Three core team members in attendance
- One Evmos governance representative in attendance
