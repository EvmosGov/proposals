## **Summary**

This thread will serve as a signaling + discussion thread regarding a possible sponsorship of the upcoming HackAtom 2022 event in Seoul which will be held July 29th to 31th.

---

## **Abstract**

HackAtom is the largest and most recognized hackathon in the Cosmos ecosystem, organized by the Interchain Foundation with its history dating [back to 2017](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cosmos-hackatom-winners-9fc083098da). A lot has happened since 2017 -- even as the world was momentarily flipped upside down, the Cosmos ecosystem continued to build, and #IBCgang as a whole has achieved countless milestones that the early builders have dreamed of.

Evmos is incredibly special in that it has the best of both worlds - EVM and Cosmos. In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554), which used the Community Pool to ultimately fund the development of Evmos without any external investments or VC backing. It is only appropriate that Evmos not only support these events, but also take these opportunities to grow our network.

Everyone is aware of the famous saying, "If you build it, they will come." The truth of the matter is, at the moment, we are lacking builders. HackAtom is the perfect opportunity to attract top notch developers in both the EVM and the Cosmos networks.

_HackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. This HackATOM will not only be the perfect chance for developers to start their journey in our ecosystem with a bang, but it will also be a real moment of sharing and growing for our entire community._

_Cosmonauts, itâ€™s been over a year since theÂ __[Stargate upgrade](https://stargate.cosmos.network/)__, the Cosmos Big-Bang that announced the start of theÂ __[Interchain Era](https://hub.mintscan.io/ibc-network)__, and since then our ecosystem has faced many challenges but, despite our differing views and opinions, we have always been united in a common front when the moment called for it, acknowledging that our diversities are what make our Interchain Ecosystem thriving._

## Community Funding Request

The following amounts requested are not final and would love the community input. The requested amount as it stands is $200K, with the bulk of it going towards sponsorship fees and hackathon prizes.

| Item  | Usage  |
|---|---|
| A  | $50K USD in Evmos tokens for the platinum sponsorship spot  |
| B  | $100K USD in Evmos tokens for hackathon prizes  |
| C  | $15K USD for booth design and Evmos merch to giveaway  |
| D  | $15K USD for airfare, hotel, and food arrangements for the core team  |
| E  | $10K USD for volunteer compensation and meal comps  |
| F  | $10K USD for any unexpected, unforeseen expenses that may arise.  |




## **Funding Request Justification**

**A. Sponsorship Fees**

Platinum Sponsorship Package Includes:

* 1 booth at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 1 workshop at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1 
* Co-host at Official Afterparty at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* Evmos marketing one-pager included in Welcome Packet 
* HackAtom badges printed with your Evmos under Platinum Sponsor 
* Evmos logo insignia on the marketing video produced during HackAtom Seoul 2022

Alternatively, there is the Gold Sponsorship Package for $30K USD, **which excludes**:

* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1

If the community feels that a Gold Sponsorship Package is more appropriate, I respect the cost-saving mindset.

**B. Hackathon Prizes**

The prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). Please participate in the polls to voice your opinion on whether we should decrease the prize amount, leave it, or go guns blazing and increase the amount to show hackers and everyone watching that we mean business.

**C. Booth and Merchandise**

Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. While the booth design is not extremely important, if we are going to be represented at HackAtom, we might as well do it professionally.

**D. Airfare, Hotel, and Food**

Late July is peak season for air travel to Korea, and hotels are nearing an all-time high in 3 years.

**E. Volunteer Compensation + Labor**

For those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with a respected Korean validator and community that are active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services,** if needed.**

**F. Emergency Fund**

Unexpected expenses are not uncommon, especially for a team in a foreign country. These funds will not be touched except under extraordinary circumstances.

## Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability 

1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to E. Whatever can transaction that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. 
2. All unused funds, including item F, will be returned to the community pool. 

## Time Constraints

July 29th is fast approaching. I will be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, so please ask any questions that you may have.
