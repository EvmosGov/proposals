# Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom 2022 Seoul and Participation in Korea Blockchain Week

## **Summary**

This thread will serve as a signaling + discussion thread regarding a possible sponsorship of the upcoming HackAtom 2022 event in Seoul which will be held July 29th to 31th, followed by ETH Seoul and Korea Blockchain Week.

---

## **Abstract**

HackAtom is the largest and most recognized hackathon in the Cosmos ecosystem, organized by the Interchain Foundation with its history dating [back to 2017](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cosmos-hackatom-winners-9fc083098da). A lot has happened since 2017 -- even as the world was momentarily flipped upside down, the Cosmos ecosystem continued to build, and #IBCgang as a whole has achieved countless milestones that the early builders have dreamed of.

Evmos is incredibly special in that it has the best of both worlds - EVM and Cosmos. In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554), which used the Community Pool to ultimately fund the development of Evmos without any external investments or VC backing. It is only appropriate that Evmos not only support these events, but also take these opportunities to grow our network.

Everyone is aware of the famous saying, "If you build it, they will come." The truth of the matter is, at the moment, we are lacking builders. HackAtom is the perfect opportunity to attract top notch developers in both the EVM and the Cosmos networks.

_HackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. This HackATOM will not only be the perfect chance for developers to start their journey in our ecosystem with a bang, but it will also be a real moment of sharing and growing for our entire community._

_Cosmonauts, itâ€™s been over a year since theÂ __[Stargate upgrade](https://stargate.cosmos.network/)__, the Cosmos Big-Bang that announced the start of theÂ __[Interchain Era](https://hub.mintscan.io/ibc-network)__, and since then our ecosystem has faced many challenges but, despite our differing views and opinions, we have always been united in a common front when the moment called for it, acknowledging that our diversities are what make our Interchain Ecosystem thriving._

## Community Funding Request

**The following amounts requested are not final and would love the community input.** The requested amount as it stands is $200K, with the bulk of it going towards hackathon prizes and developer outreach. The $50K out of $75K for marketing and PR will come from the waived sponsorship fee. 

| Item  | Usage  |
|---|---|
| A  | ~~$50K USD in Evmos tokens for the platinum sponsorship spot~~  |
| B  | $100K USD in Evmos tokens for hackathon prizes  |
| C  | $70K USD for marketing and PR expenses |
| D  | $20K USD for miscellaneous expenses and volunteer compensation |
|---|---|
| Sum  | $200K, or roughly 0.31% of the community pool*  |

\* Interchain Foundation has waived our sponsorship fee completely to give us more firepower in the outreach and events department without having to request for more community funding! A huge thank you to our IBC frens.

\** As of Jul 4th 10PM UTC+9

## **Funding Request Justification**

### **A. Sponsorship Fees**

**SPONRORSHIP FEE HAS BEEN WAIVED FOR EVMOS**

Platinum Sponsorship Package Includes:

* 1 booth at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 1 workshop at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1 
* Co-host at Official Afterparty at HackAtom Seoul 2022 
* Evmos marketing one-pager included in Welcome Packet 
* HackAtom badges printed with your Evmos under Platinum Sponsor 
* Evmos logo insignia on the marketing video produced during HackAtom Seoul 2022

### **B. Hackathon Prizes**

The prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). Please participate in the polls to voice your opinion on whether we should decrease the prize amount, leave it, or go guns blazing and increase the amount to show hackers and everyone watching that we mean business.

[Current Hackathon Challenges and Prize Pool](https://bafybeienbj44fytisfpq6a5svc5t32qcxgwjvdkqejfys2degjnhhotbkm.ipfs.dweb.link/tracks.png)

The hackathon tracks and respective rewards for the tracks will be discussed and determined with the core team as soon as signaling indicate that the community is largely in favor of this proposal.

### **C. Marketing and PR Expenses**

Please remember, these numbers are not final, and although I have initiated talks and begun budgeting research, there is still a lot of missing pieces to be filled in. The numbers that I am providing are currently derived as estimates from my past experiences with sponsoring and hosting events. Past events include Blockshow Vegas 2018, BlockchainNW Seattle 2018, LA Blockchain Week 2018, Global AI Conference in Santa Clara, Consensys 2019, LA Blockchain Week 2019, E3 2019's first blockchain gaming stage, and about a dozen smaller meetups with projects. 

**PR Expenses** - Evmos is unique in the Cosmos ecosystem because we are able to tap into a much bigger pool of developers (devs already familiar with solidity). It is my belief that if we are committing $100K into the hackathon, we should do our absolute best to make sure that there is a great turnout with talented developers. 

Right off the bat, I would like to explore one or two paid PR placements in Korea's top blockchain publications and developer networks. Depending on who, when, and how, this can range anywhere from $5K to $10K. 

I will be consulting a few blockchain incubation and investment firms that I am acquainted with for additional advice on how to best penetrate the Korean ETH developer market. There may be some last minute promotions, such as small token giveaways or ad placements in developer-heavy social networks. This may cost anywhere from $2K to $5K. 

**Marketing Expenses** - Following the HackAtom event, three events will be held consecutively: buidl.asia, ETH Seoul, and Korea Blockchain Week. This gives us a great opportunity to do further outreach beyond the scope of the hackathon, through smaller meetups, cross-promotions, and related events. Side events, when executed properly, can be much more effective than sponsoring the event itself. 

Potential "side events" - As of now, talks have been initiated, but nothing is final. A few examples would be: 1) Co-hosting an event with the Interchain Foundation; 2) Hosting an official Korea Blockchain Week 2022 Side Event; 3) Hosting our own series of mini-events in the form of workshops, networking, and hopefully catching the attention of some talented solidy developers while the biggest blockchain event to happen in Asia in over 3 years is underway. When a firm decision is made with the team on how to put the funds to best use, we will let the community know ASAP. Hosting such events can typically cost anywhere from $10K to $30K depending on the event, the venue, the number of people in attendence, and timing. 

**Media Crew** - In the case that we decide to host side events, it is a no brainer that we would want the rest of the Evmos community to be able to "join in" through live streaming and post-production videos. Depending on the circumstance, live-streaming may not make sense, but for events such as workshops, it would be great to extend the event virtually to all of our Evmos community members. A crew of one should be roughly $5K and a crew of two should be roughly $10K. Korea may be cheaper or more expensive, I admit I do not know at the moment. Updates will come as soon as I can begin the work and research needed. 

**Booth and Evmos Merch** - Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. While the booth design is not extremely important and I do not see a need for an extravagent booth, if we are going to be represented at any event, we might as well do it professionally. From past experiences, the most costly part of booths were rentals -- displays, screens, etc. I will work with the event organizers to get a better estimate of the market in Korea, but I do not see it exceeding more than $3-5K (total, not daily). 

And it's almost a rule of thumb that a project can not go to an event without bringing merch to give out. I think we can have a bit of fun with the community taking design and idea submissions. Merch should not exceed more than $3-5K, but again, I am not 100% sure, as these are just napkin math estimates because of the limited time we have in preparations. Any unused leftover merch can be given back to the Evmos community, or held on to the team for the next event. 

**Blockchain week...? More like blockchain marathon** - From start to finish, the events will last from July 29th to August 13th. This is a pretty epic blockchain marathon, and the possilities and opportunities for developer onboarding, meetups, workships, and side events are endless. Huge shoutout to Interchain Foundation, again, for allowing us to use the waived sponsorship fee for initiatives to grow our ecosystem. 

### **D. Volunteer Compensation + Miscellaneous Expenses**

For those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with BeeHive, a respected Korean validator and community that is active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services. While the event will bring the global community to Seoul, it should be expected that a huge portion of the attendees will, of course be Korean. We should respect the value of peoples' time and work, and volunteers should be provided with meals and compensation. 

At the moment since we are not 100% sure which days we will be working or hosting events (besides HackAtom), I can only estimate the amount for compensation expenses. If we were to "work" 6 days with 5 volunteers (3 days for HackAtom, 3 misc. days TBD), and a compensation of $500 per per day per volunteer, that's $3K, excluding lunch and dinner.  I am ballparking this expensive to be anywhere from $4K to $6K. 

In addition, unexpected expenses are not uncommon, especially for a team in a foreign country. An emergency fund for miscellaneous expenses, in my opinion, would be smart to have as events are very fluid and other sponsorship or outreach opportunities may come up. 

## Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability 

1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to D. Whatever  transactions that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. 
2. All unused funds will be returned to the community pool.
3. The volunteer and miscellaneous expenses fund will be placed in a multi-sig wallet, and with funds only moving in case the needs are justified. I propose three signers for this wallet -- myself, and two members of the core team that will be in attendance. 
4. 50% of the marketing and PR budget will be sent to a multi-sig wallet, while 50% will be held in a liquid wallet so that we can immediately get to work on the countless tasks and preparations that need to be made. 


I will work with the core team to be as frugal as possible, while consulting with them to take as many opportunities that would benefit Evmos and help with onboarding and exposure.  

## Time Constraints

July 29th is fast approaching. I will be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, so please ask any questions that you may have.

I would like to apologize for the currently vague sections in Items C and D, but because of the limited preparation times and unfinalized commitments, it is difficult to provide final details this early. However, I will be in constant coordination with all parties involved, and provide updates as they come. 

All these events will be happening roughly 15 minutes from where I live, so I will do my best to accomodate the core Evmos team with any logistical needs. However, I will most likely be needing external help and planning should begin ASAP, so I would appreciate any and all concerns from the community to be asked in a timely manner so that the proposal can move into the next stages ASAP. 


## Other Considerations

The cost to become an official sponsor of Korea Blockchain Week is $50K with no booth, and $100K with booth. There are more sponsorship levels that range up to $400K. I have not included these in the request, but I would like to receive sincere feedback and thoughts on whether we should sponsor this larger event. You may learn more about Korea Blockchain Week 2022 and the Sponsor packages [on their website.](https://koreablockchainweek.com/)

Alternatively, we can host a side event that is officially registered with KBC, which allows us to tap into their pool of attendees. 

Although we would like to have sponsored ETH Seoul, they are unfortunately at capacity. However, it should be noted that we also have three major hackathons already planned or in planning that are ETH-community focused, which begin as soon as these events in Korea end. In other words, you can expect the next few months to be very crazy and event-packed for the Evmos ecosystem.

With that being said, if at any point or time something doesn't feel right, or we feel that our spending is not justified, we can simply decide to not host anything, count our blessings and new frens made at HackAtom, and just spend the rest of the time spreading Evmos through good ole' fashioned networking. **I am fairly certain that our actual spending will not exceed the requested amount.** 

An additional expense request for airfare and hotel for the core team was removed at the request of a team member. If the community believes that these expenses should be covered by the pool, please indicate that in the comments.
