Operating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51)), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.

This proposal applies all rules defined and approved by the community in ECP-1 ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)).

## Preface 
Since the rejection of Proposal 86 we have been reflecting on the original proposal and the incredible feedback we received from the Evmos community and validators. Our goal was to address the community concerns and flaws of the original proposal while still upholding the stated Mission, Vision, & Values of the Governance Workstream. We believe that this updated proposal accomplishes that!

Resolved flaws from Proposal 86:
1. Total proposal token request was too high. The requested amount is reduced by 61% in this proposal. 
2. R&D and the Ecosystem Bootstrap fund were removed in order to have a more focused discussion with the community about these initiatives and potential funding associated.
3. Retroactive payment request is too high. The requested amount is reduced by 64% in this proposal. 
4. Other cost reduction efforts include the removal of 2 future workstream contributors and requesting only the first year of vesting emissions.

## Abstract

### The Governance Workstream's Mandate

The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.

### Contributions to Evmos

The Governance Workstream's wide array of contributions and community service for the past half-year range from simple proposal guidance for projects to both native and external liquidity programs responsible for the movement of tens of millions of dollars.

### Progressive Decentralization 

We also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.

While we have ambitious plans to create an ecosystem of community owned liquidity and a democratized spending of liquid funds, we have removed all funding requests related to these initiatives for various reasons - separate proposals will be made for these initiatives when we are better prepared to present them.

## Funding Request

This 6-month funding proposal has been pegged to the price of $0.40 / EVMOS. The total funding amount was reduced by ~61% to the previous proposal and represents now 1.6% of the community pool. 

- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 850,000 EVMOS
- **B. Treasury Diversification & Reserves:** 1,000,000 EVMOS
- **Total:** 1,850,000 EVMOS

**A. Contributor Compensations**

The funding ask includes the base, retro, and vesting pay for 3 existing Governance workstream members as well as the onboarding of three more members, for a total of 6 Governance workstream members.

**B. Treasury Diversification & Reserves**

One of the first treasury strengthening initiatives will be to slowly diversify our assets into stablecoins. This initiative will continue to be a core strategy of the DAO, as it allows for a safe, predictable runway of contributor payments, the usage of smart contract based DAO contributor payments systems, and is an excellent hedge against uncertain market conditions.

Our stablecoin acquisitions will not be through selling tokens on the open market, but through DAO2DAO token-for-stable swaps, sales of convertible bonds, and DeFi protocols that are available to us. Some partners we are in discussions with and plan to work with include ShapeShift DAO, Hedgey Finance, PrimeDAO, and Arbor Finance. Tokens will only be sold when absolutely necessary in small batches. 

A small reserve will be kept for operational expenses (tools, subscriptions, licenses) and micro-payments for services that do not warrant an on-chain proposal. 


### Fund Disbursements

This funding proposal will kick off the "DAO Treasury" which is managed by 3 Governance members and 4 Validators in a `4-7` Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending will be publicly viewable with full transparency. Spending, compensations, swaps, and all expense reports will be rigorously kept up to date.

**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600) (evmos1c0z326g3haflz2gnk68q2vsfv5mtxpsqgqgd0v)

The total funding request of the proposal may be adjusted accordingly in the event of market volatility and major price swings. This clause serves as a safeguard for our planned 6-month runway and our treasury diversification plans, and is a notice to the Evmos community that the final ask amount may be different than what is being presented today.
