# ECP-2A (Rev. 2) Cost Reduction Breakdown

Following the rejection of Proposal 86, we have conducted a thorough review of the initial proposal and the valuable feedback provided by the Evmos community and validators. This revised proposal was created with objectives to address issues and concerns raised by the community while remaining aligned with the Governance Workstream's Mission, Vision, and Values. We are confident that this revised proposal achieves this goal.

Addressed issues from Proposal 86:

1. The total token request has been significantly reduced by 80% in this proposal.
2. R&D and the Ecosystem Bootstrap fund have been excluded in order to facilitate a more targeted dialogue with the community regarding these initiatives and potential funding.
3. The retroactive payment request has been decreased by 64% ($750/mo per contributor).
4. Additional cost-saving measures include the elimination of 2 future workstream contributors and the request for only the first year of vesting emissions for existing members.

*We cannot truly emphasize how much we value the feedback and we continue to encourage the community to voice their opinion!*
