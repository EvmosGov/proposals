# Progress Report and Achievements

## Background

The Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.

After posting the ["Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **38 out of 40 proposals for a success rate of 95%.**

The Governance Council has been involved with 15 out of 17 passed Community Pool Spend Proposals (Excluding Proposal 66 - Recover IBC tokens from Airdrop). Which covers over **98%** of the total community pool spend!

- Total Community Pool Spend: ~5.09mil EVMOS
- Total Community Pool Spend with Gov. Council Support: ~5.0mil EVMOS

We are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.

**On-Chain Governance Participation**

Evmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend. With a participation rate of almost 90%, the Governance Workstream will most likely be fighting to maintain the status quo, as we are almost at the ceiling.

**Off-Chain Governance Participation**

In addition to all the proposals that have gone on-chain, the Evmos Community has seen a tremendous, sustained growth in off-chain governance participation, specifically on Commonwealth.
