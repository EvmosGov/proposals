# ECP-2A - FAQ and Key Questions 

We understand the importance of keeping the Evmos Community informed and up-to-date - this FAQ page will be regularly reviewed and updated as new questions and concerns arise. Please do not hesitate to reach out for further clarifications and/or concerns on Commonwealth, Discord, or Telegram.

**Q1: Are any DAO2DAO swaps already confirmed?**

We've already begun discussions with ShapeShift DAO and even temperature checked with the community ([positive sentiment](https://messari.io/governor/proposal/0d626610-2f96-4364-98b3-d05406b7baad?daoSlug=shapeshift-governance&daoTab=proposals)). Discussions kind of halted when our funding prop v1 was struck down, but I still talk to many of them daily and they are very willing to move forward with a potentially creative DAO2DAO swap that is beneficial long term for both parties.

We are also in talks with [Hedgey](https://app.hedgey.finance/dao2dao), in the process of scheduling a meeting with Arbor Financial (example [stablecoin raise](https://app.arbor.finance/offerings/399)), and we are also very keen on working with [PrimeDAO](https://deals.prime.xyz/). There dozens of other DAOs we can potentially begin discussions with, but will be waiting until for the time being.

Realistically, for the first month we will likely sell a small amount of tokens (just enough to meet the compensation requirements for that month).

**Q2: What is the timeline for the remaining ECPs to follow?**

ECP-2B will be our next target proposal, which is to formalize and fund the Community Moderation and Support team. The R&D / bounty fund will most likely follow in a few weeks on Commonwealth so that we can begin the formal drafting of ECP-3 with Community input and engineers that have worked on similar protocols.
