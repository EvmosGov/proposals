# Evmos Community Proposals

**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. 

The urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.

## ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework

**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. 

A strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. 

## ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework 

**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. 

Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.

## ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream 

**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos’ governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.

The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community for nearly half a year is finally requesting formalization by funding. 

## ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream

**Summary**: The community is the heart and soul of any project. The strength of a community’s network effect is not only determined by quantity, but the value of their interactions - it’s the face of the ecosystem. The Evmos Community Moderation and Support Workstream is a continuation of the work which began in late 2021 voluntarily. With over 30,000 Discord and 19,000 Telegram members, both platforms must be maintained professionally at the highest quality possible 24/7. 

The CMS Workstream that has been serving the Evmos Community is requesting formalization by funding.

## ECP-3: Empowering the Community with Strategic Growth Initiatives

**Summary**: Our long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.

The Phase 2 funding of the DAO’s treasury will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. Staying true to our core values of progressive decentralization and autonomy, the projects detailed in ECP-3 will empower the community through the decentralization and incentivization of off-chain governance while strengthening our network through Community-Owned Liquidity.

## ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program

**Summary**: The Foundation has voiced its desire to pass the torch for the development and funding of ecosystem grants to the DAO. Although there is yet to be a formal decision or agreement, the Governance Council has shared its vision for a decentralized, transparent, and responsible grants program. 

While we propose to create a Grants Committee to overlook the program, much like our Liquidity Incentives 2.0 proposed in ECP-3, we seek to design a system in which the community has part-ownership via the democratization of grants. 

We refuse to allow Community Funds to stream into the wallets of entities that operate in the dark.
