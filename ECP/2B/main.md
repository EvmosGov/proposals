**Summary**
The Community Moderation & Support Workstream that has been serving the Evmos Community is officially requesting formalization by funding.

## 1. Workstream Introduction 
The strength of a community is not only determined by the number of members, but also the quality of their interactions. The Evmos community represents the face of the network. As such, we believe it is pivotal to foster a supportive, respectful, engaging, and inclusive environment worthy of this representation. The Evmos Community Moderation and Support Workstream is a continuation of the work which began in late 2021 voluntarily. With over 30,000 Discord and 17,000 Telegram members, both platforms must be professionally maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
As the Evmos CMS Workstream we act as a neutral party with allegiance only to the Evmos network. We offer a trusted source of support to network users, promote community growth by maintaining a welcoming environment, and provide helpful resources, news, and updates related to the Evmos network. 

**Mission**: Protect, educate, support, inform, and grow the Evmos community. As well as foster an engaging and inclusive environment.

**Vision**: To see the Evmos Community platforms grow into an invaluable resource for the Evmos network and it's users.

**Values**: Equality, Positivity, Continuos Education

## 2. Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)
### A. Respond to inquiries from Evmos community members
The Evmos CMS Workstream serves to help and support each member of the community. Our contribution stretches over all relevant social platforms like Discord, Reddit and Telegram. We manage user issues by providing solutions and options within reasonable time limits and follow up to ensure resolution. We encourage safe practices and keep scammers out of the communities by integration and maintaining state of the art bots. 

### B. Maintain direct lines with Evmos-Core
The CMS workstream acts as a close entity to the Evmos core team. They are our primary source for development progress. As such, we hold regular meetings to keep us updated with the latest ongoings. Additionally, we give feedback of user experiences (bug reports), test new features (conversions, tools, etc.) and help them out whenever it is necessary. 

### C. Prepare written materials and guidance on the use of the Evmos network
Moderators have been hard at work bolstering the knowledge-base resources available to members of the Evmos community. As new features launches, the CMS creates instructional guides aimed at educating users on how to interact with them. As Evmos is built on top of two different runtimes (Cosmos and EVM) the complexity is quite high. As such, written materials and guidance has besides supporting the community the highest value proposition.

## 3. Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)

### A. Social Awareness and Self Independence
The CMS workstream will act as an independent DAO entity. While being such an important figure within the Evmos network, it is crucial to actively create social awareness and broaden its outreach. Therefore, the CMS workstream will create and grow its own brand - similar to [OsmoSupportLab](https://twitter.com/OsmoSupportLab)

### B. Community Incentives
There are people outside of Community Support that make the community vibrant. Through adding to discussions, creating guides, participating in governance, helping out where they see help is needed. And that sort of contribution ought to be recognized.

The Evmos Community Rewards Program (ECRP) is an CMS Workstream initiative aimed at fostering adoption and supporting the Evmos ecosystem. Up to 5000 Evmos are rewarded to those that stand out in merit and act in the interest of the Evmos ecosystem as a whole. Any Evmos not rewarded in a given period will be rolled over for future use in the program. These rewards will be publicly announced on our socials in a transparent and traceable manner. Only non-paid contributors will be taken into consideration. 

## 4. Progress Report and Achievements 
Since January 2022, Evmos CMS has resolved nearly 3,000 support tickets and assisted countless others through public and private chats on Discord, Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter. We’ve been there to help support and guide the community through key issues such as the chain halts, the Nomad hack, airdrop and Ledger issues. Along with day-to-day problems solved and clarifications given. Evmos CMS needs an assortment of skill sets, most importantly a deep familiarity with both Cosmos and EVM tooling, this sets Evmos CMS apart from other support teams.

## 5. Workstream Members and Organizational Structure 
### A. Moderator Types 
Community Moderators shall be composed of three (3) position types: 

**1. Jr Moderators:** These Moderators will be the backbone of Evmos support and community moderation. Handling various tasks from enforcing server rules to providing general support.
**2. Sr Moderators:** These Moderators will have the same responsibilities of Jr moderators, but they will also take on a larger role with more accountability. Additional duties include training new Jr moderators, handling inquiries between various chains, projects and points of contact, handling server security and keeping track of KPIs.
**3. CMS Workstream Leader:** This individual will have the same responsibilities of Sr Moderators, but will be accountable for the overall performance of the workstream. The CMS lead will also represent the workstream within the Evmos DAO Governance Council. Being part of the Evmos DAO multisig and handling transactions relating to pay. As well as being a primary contact between the Evmos Community Moderator and Support Workstream and the foundation. This role may also be responsible for delivering concise, quick and knowledgeable solutions in case of emergency. 

### B. Salary Starting 1st March 2023 + Retroactive Compensation
Given the current climate, pay has decreased across the Cosmos ecosystem for similar roles and positions. Evmos, a layer 1 network, presents unique challenges that require versatility unmatched by other Cosmos chains. Mods need to be knowledgeable in both IBC and EVM technology and infrastructure! With this in mind we propose the following pay schedule and conditions:

**Conditions**
- Hourly requirement per week: 24
- Minimum Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystem experience: 3 months
- Internal  KPI metrics
- Salary JR: 3,360 (USD)
- Salary SR: 4,032 (USD)

**Salary**
The compensation is based on the approved framework of [ECP-1 | Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83).
Thus, the salary is calculated as follows:
- Jr: $28 * 1.25 * (160hr/mt * 0.6) = 3,360
- Sr: $28 * 1.50 * (160hr/mt * 0.6) = 4,032

*RETRO: One time payment for retroactive unpaid work
*RETRO FORMULA: <code>($2,500 * CONTRIBUTED_MONTHS)/TOKEN_PRICE </code>
*BONUS: One time payment for recognition of past significant contribution to the network.
*VESTING (1y): <code>(Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level)/4(years)</code>
`*TOKEN_PRICE: 0.40 USD and is subject to change`

**Retroactive Compensation Rationale** 
Cozmo has been working completely unpaid as primarily a Telegram moderator since January 14, 2022. All other current and former moderators were compensated by Tharsis as contractors at a rate of 2500 USDC per month. This contract requires the individual to complete the KYC process with Tharsis, which Cozmo has opted against.

We respect Cozmo's decision to opt against completing the KYC process and recognize his important contribution to the community and dedication to working over a year unpaid. This proposal requests 85,438 EVMOS for retroactive payment at the contract rate equivalent to $2,500 per month during his tenure as a moderator.
*RETRO FORMULA: <code>($2,500 * 13.67 (CONTRIBUTED_MONTHS thru Feb. 2023))/TOKEN_PRICE </code>

**Bonus Compensation Rationale** 
The CMS workstream often spent full-time week hours into supporting the Evmos community since its inception. Navigating significant events like the chain halt, nomad exploit and airdrop claim issues were especially challenging for moderators and the community alike. 

As recognition for this pivotal contribution and support for the network, this proposal requests 50,000 EVMOS to be shared amongst current & past moderators based on their time contributed. This amounts to 613 EVMOS per month contributed, per person. 

Bennylava, GV, & Kilo have opted against being included in this bonus pool.

**Vesting Rationale**
We truly believe the long term growth of Evmos network should be aligned with long term incentives. As such, we propose a vesting account for each CMS member. The vesting logic is based on the [ECP-1C | Standardizing Contributor Compensations](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7630-ecp1cwip-standardizing-contributor-compensations) framework. The formula is <code>Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level</code>

Conditions: 
- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.
- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as WEVMOS to contributors.
- As everyone’s Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.
- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.
- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent – thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO.
- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.



### C. Accountability 
Each CMS member is measured and accountable for their performance. This will be tracked with internal KPI metrics, such as tickets attended to, moderation commands used, time spent in the server and so on. If an individual CM is struggling to fulfill their duties, CMS leadership will work with them to understand the root cause and provide the necessary support and training.

## 6. Total Funding Request
This proposal requests funding for a 6 month period beginning March 2023. Retroactive compensation and Bonus compensation is a one-time event for the past hard and loyal work of the moderators during 2022. Any unused tokens at the end of the funding period will be rolled into the next period.

### Fund Dispursements 
Funds will be distributed to the DAO Treasury 5/8 multisig from [Proposal 113](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/113). The DAO Treasury will distribute the workstreams salary in a batch transaction from the DAO safe wallet on a monthly basis.
