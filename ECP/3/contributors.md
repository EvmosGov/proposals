- Vesting amounts are calculated in USD but paid in EVMOS at each funding cycle's market price. The requested amount is for half a year of vesting emission. 
- For this initial funding request, we will peg the price of EVMOS @0.08$
- Vesting Schedule: 4-year linear, 6 month cliff. 
- Vesting contracts are revocable by the DAO.

On top of the projected costs a buffer of 1M Evmos ($80k) is included to help protect against price volatility. Any non-rewarded EVMOS in a given funding cycle will be rolled over to the next cycle.

Final request of **4.47M EVMOS** is composed of: 3.05M EVMOS (base) + 0.42M EVMOS (vesting) + 1M EVMOS (buffer)
