# ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework 

**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council

**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. 

**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.

One of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:

 - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)
 - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. 
 - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. 
 - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. 
 - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed

However, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. 

**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well funded, and a self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in.

## 1. Definition and Purpose

Workstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).

Workstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.

## 2. Workstream Requirements

Anyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:

 - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the 
 - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.
 - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in
 - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI
 - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. 


## 3. Workstream Formation Process

Workstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)

The burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.

A great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.

## 4. Workstream Stages

Workstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:

 - Informal
 - Proposed
 - Active
 - Inactive


## 5. Contributor Compensation Model

Our goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.

**Compensation Principles**

The Compensation Model is based off the following core principles:

1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.
2) **Accountability**: all constributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community
3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.
4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to ajust and properly accomodate new contributors as the DAO grows.
5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates
6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors' with the long-term goals of the DAO. Talented and dedicated members should want to remain working with the DAO.

**Compensation Types**

1) **Retroactive Compensation**: compensation and rewards for previous contributions made to the DAO. There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.
2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. 
3) **Vested Compensation**: Revokable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. 

**Compensation Eligibility**

Compensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO. The contributor's duties and responsibilities must be clearly outlined when the workstream is being proposed for funding, or during the onboarding process of new workstream members. 

When a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:

- The role the contributor plays
- The weekly time commitment
- The monthly compensation amount
- Compensation rationale (base and vested)

**Standard Vesting Schedule**: 3-year linear vesting with a 6 month cliff.

Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contract through the Gnosis Safe for contributors that are no longer able to fulfill his or her duty.
