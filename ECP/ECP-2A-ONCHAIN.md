## Summary

[ECP-2](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md) is the follow-up proposal of [ECP-1](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md), which set the foundational layer for Evmos DAO Governance ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)).

Operating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO (Proposal #51), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past six months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.

## Abstract

### Foreword

The overwhelming community support and the shared beliefs in our vision have been truly inspiring. The support shown by the community is not taken for granted - our pledge for progressive decentralization is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to working to build a stronger, brighter ecosystem for Evmos. For those that want to deep-dive into the philosophical reasoning behind our proposal, [a prologue has been published (warning: long read).](https://mirror.xyz/evmosdao.eth/rSZyD_MAO4zkA46lvqi-f9P5YfVBrnMsU3TShBWK-sY)

### The Governance Council 

The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.

The Governance Council's wide array of achievements and community work for the past half-year are listed in the *Progress Report* section of ECP-2A.

Get familiarized with our short to mid-term initiatives with through the [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper).

## Funding Request

We recognize the current market conditions and its volatility, while unfortunate, we must continue to push forward. We have pegged the price of Evmos to $0.50 for this Funding Cycle (6-months).

- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 1,233,668 EVMOS
- **B. Research & Development Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS
- **C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund:** 750,000 EVMOS
- **D. Treasury Diversification & Future WS Comps:** 1,560,000 EVMOS
- **TOTAL:** 4,518,668 EVMOS (~753,111 EVMOS / month)

We are currently in talks with a few Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams via a token-for-stable swap. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our operational runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market.

A more detailed itemized list of requested funds can be found in the full [ECP-2 Proposal](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md) and the Litepaper.

### Fund Disbursements

This funding proposal will kick off the "DAO Treasury - Phase 1" which is managed by 3 Council Members and 3 Active Validators in a `4-6` Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending is publicly available for viewing with full transparency.

**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223) (evmos1670l07l2533t0w9tvd529uaz20majs3rf57zgz)

**DAO Treasury - Phase 2** will be implemented when ready. This change in Treasury Management will mean funds will need to pass off-chain spending proposals as shown in the Litepaper.
