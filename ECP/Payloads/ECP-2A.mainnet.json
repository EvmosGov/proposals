    "description": "## Authors\n\n - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n - GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n## Summary\n[ECP-2A](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html) is the follow-up proposal of [ECP-1](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md), which set the foundational layer for Evmos DAO Governance ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)).\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO (Proposal #51), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past six months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n### Important Notice\n\nThis post has been modified to fit within the maximum allowed character count.\n\n- [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper)\n- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (GitHub)](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md)\n- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (HTML)](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html)\n## Abstract\n### Foreword\nThe overwhelming community support and the shared beliefs in our vision have been truly inspiring. The support shown by the community is not taken for granted - our pledge for progressive decentralization is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to working to build a stronger, brighter ecosystem for Evmos. For those that want to deep-dive into the philosophical reasoning behind our proposal, [a prologue has been published (warning: long read).](https://mirror.xyz/evmosdao.eth/rSZyD_MAO4zkA46lvqi-f9P5YfVBrnMsU3TShBWK-sY)\n### The Governance Council\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\nThe Governance Council's wide array of achievements and community work for the past half-year are listed in the *Progress Report* section of ECP-2A.\n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and even replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\nGet familiarized with our short to mid-term initiatives with through the [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper).\n## Funding Request\nWe recognize the current market conditions and its volatility, while unfortunate, we must continue to push forward. We have pegged the price of Evmos to $0.50 for this Funding Cycle (6-months).\n\n- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 1,233,668 EVMOS\n- **B. Research & Development Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **D. Treasury Diversification & Future WS Comps:** 1,560,000 EVMOS\n- **Total:** 4,743,668 EVMOS (~790,611 EVMOS / month, ~4.2% of CommunityPool)\n\nWe are currently in talks with a few Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams via a token-for-stable swap. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our operational runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market.\n\nA more detailed itemized list of requested funds can be found in the full proposal as well as the the Litepaper.\n### Fund Disbursements\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury - Phase 1\" which is managed by 3 Council Members and 3 Active Validators in a 4-6 Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending is publicly available for viewing with full transparency.\n\n**Fund Signatories**:\n\n- Tam | TC Network\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Benny | Governance\n- LPX | Governance\n- GV | Governance\n\n**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223)\n(evmos1670l07l2533t0w9tvd529uaz20majs3rf57zgz)\n\n**DAO Treasury - Phase 2** will be implemented when ready. This change in Treasury Management will mean funds will need to pass off-chain spending proposals as shown in the Litepaper.\n\nðŸ‘‰ [ECP-2A: Full Proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md)\n\nðŸ‘‰ [ECP-2A: Full Proposal HTML Version](https://www.evmos.community/ECP/2A.html)\n\nðŸ‘‰ [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper)",
